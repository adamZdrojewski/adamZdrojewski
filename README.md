### Hello!
My name is Adam Zdrojewski and I like to program for fun!  I like developing services that can be ran in a web browser because it allows pretty much any device to have access to it.  I mainly work by myself on smaller projects and tools that I run on my homelab; however, I am always willing to work with others on projects as well!
