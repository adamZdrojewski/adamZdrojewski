### Hello!
My name is Adam Zdrojewski and I like to program for fun!  I like web development because it can provide a good logical challenge with a lot of moving pieces while still having an artistic and design component as well.  I mainly work by myself on smaller projects usually relating to game shows and the software that runs the different components of the game.
